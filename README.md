# The Aura Programming Language
Aura is a statically-typed language that compiles to Go. Its clean and minimal syntax is mainly influenced by Go, but also takes inspiration from, among others, Kotlin, C#, and Ballerina.

Development of Aura is currently ongoing, and the near future of the language promises many breaking changes. In the meantime, the best source of information about Aura is the wiki, although even that at times may reflect where the language is headed more than where its at right now.
